**Review Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**System Status:** 🎉 **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

## 🎯 WHAT I DID

### 1. ✅ Fixed MongoDB Connection Issue
**Problem:** Seed script was failing with "Command insert requires authentication"

**Solution:**
- Fixed MongoDB URI format (was using wrong port and format)
- Changed from `mongodb://localhost:27027` to proper Atlas format
- Added `dotenv` package to load environment variables in scripts
- Updated seed scripts to load `.env.local` properly

**Result:** ✅ Database seeding now works perfectly

### 2. ✅ Seeded Test Data
**Users Created:**
```
1. Admin Account
   Email: admin@dokimas.com
   Password: Test123!
   Role: admin

2. Retail Manager

   Password: Test123!
   Role: retail_manager

3. Customer Account
   Email: customer@dokimas.com

   Role: customer
```

**Products Created:**
```
8 Sample Products (5 Skincare + 3 Makeup)
- All with professional images
- All with detailed descriptions
- All with pricing and stock
- All SEO-optimized
- Ready for testing
```

### 3. ✅ Verified System Operation
**Tested:**
- ✅ Server running on port 3000
- ✅ Database connected to MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Health check API working
- ✅ Products API returning data
- ✅ All endpoints operational
- ✅ No errors in compilation
