npm run dev
```

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### Important Files to Know

1. **`src/types/index.ts`** - All TypeScript types
2. **`src/models/`** - MongoDB schemas
3. **`src/lib/auth/`** - Authentication logic
4. **`src/lib/helpers.ts`** - Utility functions
5. **`src/components/ui/`** - Reusable UI components

### Conventions to Follow

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow existing folder structure
- Use `successResponse()` and `errorResponse()` in APIs
- Protect routes with `requireAuth()` or `requireRole()`
- Always `await connectDB()` before DB operations
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency

### Best Practices

- Write JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Add TypeScript types for all parameters
- Keep components small and focused
- Use server components where possible
- Optimize images with next/image
- Follow the existing naming conventions
