## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Seed Script Fails
**Error:** "Command insert requires authentication"

**Solution:**
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas
2. Database Access → dakimas → Edit
3. Set to "Atlas admin"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Run `npm run seed`

**Workaround:**
Register users through UI, manually verify in MongoDB

### Issue: Can't Login
**Check:**
1. Is `emailVerified: true` in MongoDB?
2. Is user active?
3. Is password correct?

### Issue: Wrong Dashboard
**Check:**
User role in MongoDB should be:
- `"customer"` → /dashboard/customer
- `"admin"` → /dashboard/admin  
- `"retail_manager"` → /dashboard/retail
