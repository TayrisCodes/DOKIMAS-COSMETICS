## 🐛 MONGODB ATLAS PERMISSION ISSUE

You're still seeing this error in the seed script:
```
Command insert requires authentication
```

**This is because the MongoDB user needs permissions. Here's the fix:**

### Fix MongoDB Atlas Permissions:

1. Go to: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Click **"Database Access"** (left sidebar)
3. Find user: **dakimas**
4. Click **"Edit"**
5. Under "Database User Privileges", select: **"Atlas admin"**
6. Click **"Update User"**
7. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Also Check Network Access:

1. Click **"Network Access"**
2. Make sure you have: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow access from anywhere)
3. If not, click **"Add IP Address"** → **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** → **"Confirm"**

### After fixing, try seed again:

```bash
npm run seed
```

**Should see:**
```
✅ MongoDB Connected
✅ Created Admin User
✅ Created Retail Manager
✅ Created Customer User
🎉 Seed completed successfully!
```

---

## 💡 WORKAROUND (Current Method)

Since the seed script isn't working yet, just:

1. **Register users through the UI** ✅
2. **Manually verify in MongoDB Atlas** ✅
3. **Change roles if needed** ✅

This is actually good practice - you're testing the registration flow!
